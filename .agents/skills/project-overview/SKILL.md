# Project overview — omnis

A **generic, vendor-neutral agent harness** in Go, inspired by Anthropic's
**Claude Code** methodology. Module path: `github.com/blouargant/omnis`.

## The single most important rule

> The harness is generic and stays generic. The agent's effective
> capability on any run = union of mounted **tools + skills + MCP
> servers**. The same the root binary binary becomes a code reviewer, a K8s
> diagnostician, a DBA, etc., purely by changing what is mounted.
> **Never bake a domain into Go code or a system prompt.**

If a change you are about to make adds domain knowledge to a `.go` file
or to `core/agentkit/agentkit.go`'s `SystemPrompt`, **stop and put it in
a `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` instead.**

## Stack

- Go ≥ 1.25, no third-party LLM SDKs in `go.mod`.
- Built on top of `google.golang.org/adk` (agent loop, runner, session,
  plugins, toolsets, MCP, skill loader).
- Multi-provider LLM dispatcher: gemini / anthropic / openai /
  openai_compat (last three are direct HTTP+SSE adapters in
  `core/llm/`).

## When in doubt

- Adding behaviour for a new domain → skill (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).
- Adding a new tool surface → load via MCP (`config/mcp_config.json`).
- Adding a destructive verb → pair it with a `permissions.json` rule.
- Adding a generic capability to the agent → new tool in `core/tools` or
  `internal/`, then wired into `main.go (root)`.
- Touching the `SystemPrompt` → ask yourself first: is this about
  *method* (good) or about a *domain* (bad)?

## Where to look first when starting work

1. Read this skill (you just did).
2. Read the [`build-and-test`](../build-and-test/SKILL.md) skill before
   running anything.
3. Read the [`coding-conventions`](../coding-conventions/SKILL.md) skill
   before writing Go.
4. Pick the relevant task-specific skill below and follow it.
